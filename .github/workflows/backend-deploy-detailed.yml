# Rollback guidance:
# - The build job uploads artifacts that are kept by GitHub Actions for a limited time.
# - To rollback, re-run the appropriate deploy job and choose a previous workflow run's artifact
#   (Actions -> workflow run -> Re-run jobs -> select the desired run with artifacts).
# - For automated rollback logic, consider implementing deployment slots in Azure and swapping on failure.
