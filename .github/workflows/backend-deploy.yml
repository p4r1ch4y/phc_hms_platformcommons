      # The Azure deployment steps below assume you have created a Web App in Azure
      # and added its publish profile as a repo secret named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE
      # per service. For multiple services, create multiple jobs or multiple publish
      # profile secrets and reuse this step with the appropriate 'app-name' and
      # 'package' values.

# Notes:
# - Create Azure Web Apps and add their publish profiles as repository secrets.
# - Set Supabase DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET as GitHub repo secrets and configure
#   them in your Azure Web App configuration as environment variables.
# - For a simplified flow, deploy only the minimal set of services required for demo
#   (api-gateway + auth-service + one core service).
